# Interview Scheduler
Interview Scheduler is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to book technical interviews between students and mentors.

In this project, i learned to:
- Use React to create a single page application (SPA) called Interview Scheduler.
- Have the client application communicate with an API server over HTTP, using Axios to make calls to the API.
- Gain experience with different development environments, including Storybook, Jest, and Webpack Dev Server.
